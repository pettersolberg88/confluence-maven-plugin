=======================

## Description

`confluence-maven-plugin` enables you to maintain confluence pages whitin your 
code and update a confluence space when your are ready to do that.   
Pages has to be written using Markdown syntax.

__WARNING This is a *work in progress*__

## Usage

The plugin is deployed on Sonatype Maven repository. So all you need to do is
add these lines in your `pom.xml`:

```xml

		<groupId>com.github.sixro</groupId>
		<artifactId>confluence-maven-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
		<executions>
			<execution>
				<id>confluence-deploy</id>
				<goals>
					<goal>deploy</goal>
				</goals>
				<configuration>
					<!-- this is the server id used to lookup in your
					     settings.xml for username and password needed to access 
						 to your confluence
					  -->
					<serverId>myconfluence</serverId>
					<!-- this is the XMLRPC endpoint URL of your confluence -->
					<endpoint>http://myconfluence:9090/rpc/xmlrpc</endpoint>
					<-- represents the space key of your confluence space -->
					<spaceKey>MYSPACE</spaceKey>
					<!-- represents the page ID of your readme -->
					<readmePageId>MyParent+page</readmePageId>
				</configuration>

## Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives

The main reason I created this tool, is the possibility to have on my company
projects the same "feeling" I have with Github projects. I would like to have
a `README.md` in the root of my company projects and I would like to be able to
read the same content on a confluence space.

Another reason is the inspiration I had when I read this post of 
Tom Preston-Werner on [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).

An alternative to this project is [maven-confluence-plugin](https://code.google.com/p/maven-confluence-plugin/).
It is different from `confluence-maven-plugin`, because it is more involved with maven site style. So
it is useful if what you need is a site style page on your confluence space.
