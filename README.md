=======================

## Description

`confluence-maven-plugin` enables you to maintain confluence pages near your 
source code, and update a confluence space when your are ready to do that.
Pages has to be written using Markdown syntax.

*WARNING This is a _work in progress_*

## Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives

The main reason I created this tool, is the possibility to have on my company
projects the same "feeling" I have with Github projects. I would like to have
a `README.md` in the root of my company projects and I would like to be able to
read the same content on a confluence space.

Another reason is the inspiration I had when I read this post of 
Tom Preston-Werner on [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).

An alternative to this project is [maven-confluence-plugin](https://code.google.com/p/maven-confluence-plugin/).
It is different from mine, because it is more involved with maven site style. So
it is useful is what you need is a site style page on your confluence space.
