confluence-maven-plugin
=======================

`confluence-maven-plugin` is a Maven plugin useful to manage pages on a
confluence space.   
The idea is to provide a tool with which you can handle projects in the same
manner you can do using Github. E.g. adding a README.md in the root of your
project, you'll be able to upload it on a confluence space.

The main reason I created this tool, is the possibility to have on my company
projects the same "feeling" I have with Github projects. Another reason is the
inspiration I had when I read this post of Tom Preston-Werner on [Readme Driven
Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).
