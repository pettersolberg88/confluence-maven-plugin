confluence-maven-plugin
=======================

## Description

`confluence-maven-plugin` enables you to maintain confluence pages whitin your 
code and update a confluence space when your are ready to do that.   
Pages has to be written using Markdown syntax.

__WARNING This is a *work in progress*__

## Usage

The plugin is deployed on Sonatype Maven repository. So all you need to do is
add these lines in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
    <plugin>
		<groupId>com.github.sixro</groupId>
		<artifactId>confluence-maven-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
		<executions>
			<execution>
				<id>confluence-deploy</id>
				<goals>
					<goal>deploy</goal>
				</goals>
				<configuration>
					<serverId>myconfluence</serverId>
					<endpoint>http://myconfluence:9090/rpc/xmlrpc</endpoint>
					<spaceKey>MYSPACE</spaceKey>
					<parentTitle>MyParent title</parentTitle>
				</configuration>
			</execution>
		</executions>
	</plugin>
```

where `serverId` is a server identified that has to be found in your
`${HOME}/.m2/settings.xml` and that contains credentials to use when plugin has
to login to your confluence, `endpoint` is the `XMLRPC` endpoint URL of your
confluence, `spaceKey` is the space key of your `project` (or where you want to
upload your content) and `parentTitle` is the title of a parent page of which
your `README.md` content will be added as a child.

**PAY ATTENTION**: your `README.md` won't be uploaded with a title `README` but
with the title that you'll put inside of it (e.g. the text starting with a
single `#` character. See Markdown syntax for details).

### `settings.xml` example

Here you can find an example on what to add in your `${HOME}\.m2\settings.xml`.
As you can see we added a `server` with an `id` matching the `serverId` added
below. Than we configured a `username` and `password` matching credentials on
our confluence:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" 
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>myconfluence</id>
			<username>aUsername</username>
			<password>aPassword</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
```

## Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives

The main reason I created this tool, is the possibility to have on my company
projects the same "feeling" I have with Github projects. I would like to have
a `README.md` in the root of my company projects and I would like to be able to
read the same content on a confluence space.

Another reason is the inspiration I had when I read this post of 
Tom Preston-Werner on [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).

An alternative to this project is [maven-confluence-plugin](https://code.google.com/p/maven-confluence-plugin/).
It is different from `confluence-maven-plugin`, because it is more involved with maven site style. So
it is useful if what you need is a site style page on your confluence space.
